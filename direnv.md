# Direnv

This handy little tool lets you set environment variables, etc. when you enter a directory via the command line. Handy if you're doing python development in a virtualenv. On Ubuntu you can get it via ``$ sudo apt-get install direnv``. The latest version is probably on github, but this works great!
